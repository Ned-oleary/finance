# A tool for grabbing historical financials in an excel-ready format

Lets the user create an account and download a CSV of historical financials.

Exists mostly as a experimental practice exercise in NextJS + flask (e.g. credentials-based auth, nextJS routing). Because it's a toy app that I use for fiddling with tools, the code remains a bit messy.
